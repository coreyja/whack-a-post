### Install Manually (Unsigned)

**NOT RECOMMENDED PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK**

You can also the Addon manually from the Github Releases BUT it is unsigned so will require one of the following Firefox versions: Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR), Firefox Developer Edition and Nightly
If you have one of these you can proceed IFF you are willing to allow unsigned extensions. If not its probably best to wait for the Addon to get approvd

1. Got to `about:config` and set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false
1. Download the `whack-a-mole.zip` file from the Releases on Github: https://github.com/coreyja/whack-a-post/releases/download/v1.0/whack-a-mole.zip
1. Navigate to `about:addons`. From here click the Gear icon, and then `Install Addon From File...`
